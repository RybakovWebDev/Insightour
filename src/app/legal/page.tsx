        <strong>2. COOKIES</strong>
        <br />
        Insightour collects information, which may include personal data, from your br/owser when you use our Platform.
        We use a variety of methods, such as cookies and pixel tags to collect this information, which may include your
        (i) IP address; (ii) unique cookie identifier, cookie information and information on whether your device has
        software to access certain features; (iii) unique device identifier and device type; (iv) domain, br/owser type
        and language, (v) operating system and system settings; (vi) country and time zone; (vii) previously visited
        websites; (viii) information about your interaction with our Platform such as click behavior, purchases and
        indicated preferences; and (ix) access times and referring URLs.
        <br />
        Third parties may also collect information via our Platform through cookies, third party plug-ins and widgets.
        These third parties collect data directly from your web br/owser and the processing of this data is subject to
        their own privacy policies.
        <br />
        We use cookies and pixel tags to track our customers’ usage of the Platform and to understand our customers’
        preferences (such as country and language choices). This enables us to provide services to our customers and
        improve their online experience. We also use cookies and pixel tags to obtain aggregate data about Platform
        traffic and interaction, to identify trends and obtain statistics so that we can improve our Platform. There are
        generally three categories of cookies used on our Platform:
        <br />● Functional: These cookies are required for basic site functionality and are therefore always enabled.
        These include cookies that allow you to be remembered as you explore our Platform within a single session or, if
        you request, from session to session. They help make the shopping bag and checkout process possible as well as
        assist in security issues and conforming to regulations.
        <br />● Performance: These cookies allow us to improve our Platform’s functionality by tracking usage. In some
        cases, these cookies improve the speed with which we can process your request and allow us to remember site
        preferences you have selected. Refusing these cookies may result in poorly-tailored recommendations and slow
        site performance.
        <br />● Social media and Advertising: Social media cookies offer the possibility to connect you to your social
        networks and share content from our Platform through social media. Advertising cookies (of third parties)
        collect information to help better tailor advertising to your interests, both within and beyond our Platform. In
        some cases, these cookies involve the processing of your personal data. Refusing these cookies may result in
        seeing advertising that is not as relevant to you or you not being able to link effectively with Facebook,
        Twitter, or other social networks and/or not allowing you to share content on social media.
        <br />
        <strong>3. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
        <br />
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
        other legal requirements).
        <br />
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible.
        <br />
        <strong>4. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong>
        <br />
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to
        protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
        secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
        guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
        unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
        modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
        personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
        secure environment.
        <br />
        <strong>5. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong>
        <br />
        Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be
        express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
        any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in
        the section &apos;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&apos; below.
        <br />
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
        applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
        lawful processing grounds other than consent.
        <br />
        Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional
        communications at any time by or by contacting us using the details provided in the section &apos;HOW CAN YOU
        CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&apos; below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may
        still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the
        administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.{" "}
        <br />
        Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web br/owsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you
        can usually choose to set your br/owser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies
        or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.
        <br />
        <strong>6. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</strong>
        <br />
        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
        &apos;Revised&apos; date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make
        material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such
        changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to
        be informed of how we are protecting your information.
        <br />
        <strong>7. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</strong>
        <br />
        Based on the applicable laws of your country, you may have the right to request access to the personal
        information we collect from you, change that information, or delete it. To request to review, update, or delete
        your personal information, please fill out and submit a data subject access request.
